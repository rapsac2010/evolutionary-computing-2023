Welcome to the git repository for the paper "Efficient Parameter Tuning for NSGA-II in Training Multi-Objective Generalist Game-Playing Agents". In this paper, we discuss the use of NSGA-II, an evolutionary algorithm designed for solving multi-objective problems, and the importance of tuning its hyperparameters to improve performance. We investigate whether efficient parameter tuning can increase the performance of NSGA-II in training a multi-objective, generalist game-playing agent and test the generalizability of the algorithm using differently-sized objective groups during training.

Our report aims to answer the question of whether efficient parameter tuning can increase the performance of NSGA-II and provides insights into more informed methods of hyperparameter search, such as successive halving and Bayesian optimization, that could improve the efficiency of tuning for hyperparameters of evolutionary algorithms.

We have included the code used in our experiments and the datasets used in this study to encourage reproducibility of our results. We hope that our research can contribute to the advancement of evolutionary algorithms and multi-objective optimization techniques in the field of machine learning.

The code and report was written by Jacco Broere, Evaline Bosch, Gijs van Meer and Caspar Hentenaar during the evolutionary computing course given in 2023 at the VU Amsterdam.
